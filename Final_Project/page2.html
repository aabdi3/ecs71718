            <pre>A Beautiful Rose
            
                A breathtaking rose stood in the middle of a garden
Its petals deep blood red
As it swayed to the whispering of the wind,It caught the eye of the beholder
It was nobody, until just now, it became a somebody
Just like Aphrodite, its perfume lured people in
But it’s thorn stood out like sore thump
The beholder wasn’t satisfied. For it wanted a perfect rose
More water and fertilizer was fed to the rose
And in the end, those efforts were fruitless

A beautiful rose it was. Until its beauty came to an end.
Its delicate red petals dried like life was sucked out of it
Slowly, those delicate red petals fell one by one
Just like how the rose was forgotten, day by day
It leaned forward with great agony
Who was going to love a withered and dried up rose?
Nobody because it was not beautiful anymore
It grieved until it died
A beautiful rose it was.</pre>

           <pre>Until Then

Cries of agony wakes my soul up
Eyes filled with tears great my view
As I make contact with them
I’m pulled into an abyss of misery
I did not want to make you cry
But I could not stop Hermes from taking my soul
For he is to lead wandering soul to their destiny
Just like how life has an ending and beginning

There lied my lifeless form
That was given to us by god
For we were to return it to him in the end
I’m sorry I couldn't stay with you until the end
But know that this is not the end 
I’m not dead
So don’t let despair devour you
For we will meet as slaves of god
In the day of judgement
So my beloved, 
Be aware of the choices you make
For life is just a test.
